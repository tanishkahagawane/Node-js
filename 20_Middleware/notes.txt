middleware : 

In Node.js, especially when using frameworks like Express.js, 
middleware functions are a key concept. 
They are essentially functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res),
and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 

Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks, such as:

1.Processing Requests			 	: They can modify the request object or perform tasks like logging request details.

2.Authentication and Authorization	: Middleware can check if a user is authenticated or has the necessary
									  permissions to access certain resources.

3.Error Handling					: Specialized middleware can handle errors that occur during request processing.

4.Request Validation				: They can validate and sanitize request data before it reaches your route handlers.

5.Response Modification       		: Middleware can modify the response object before it’s sent to the client.

6.Serving Static Files				: Middleware can be used to serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript from a directory.

----------
middleware can be categorized into:

Application-Level Middleware: Applies to all routes (e.g., logging, body parsing).
Router-Level Middleware: Applies to specific routes (e.g., route-specific checks).
Built-in Middleware: Provided by Express (e.g., express.json(), express.static()).
Third-Party Middleware: From npm packages (e.g., morgan, cors).
Error-Handling Middleware: Handles errors in the application.
Custom Middleware: User-defined for specific tasks (e.g., authentication).
Asynchronous Middleware: Handles asynchronous operations.
