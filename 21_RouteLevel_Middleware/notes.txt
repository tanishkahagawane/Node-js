Router-level middleware in Node.js is a type of middleware that's similar to application-level middleware, but it's limited to a specific instance of Express.Router(). It's used to run for all routes in a router object. 

Difference between the App-level and route-level middleware:

App-level middleware
- An intermediate implementation binds to an expression using app.use ()
- It is a universal and applicable to all methods globally.
- It is complete for all the applications except of route.
- Small granular control for tasks that need to be implemented globally.
- Applications have methods of listening and other methods.
- The application “does” the main role.


route-level middleware
- Router level middleware works the same as application-level middleware, except that they depend on the express. Router () instance.
- The source of routing group or route is specific.
- Only done when the specified path matches.
- More control, ideal for certain tasks.
- Routers have no methods like this.
- While routing only groups some routes and provides encapsulation.
