In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.

1.Core Modules
Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and come with Node.js installation. These modules can be loaded into the program by using the required function.

ex.
1.console
2.fs
3.Buffer
4.HTTP

Global modules

- modules which doesn't re to import
- ex. console,__dirname,__filename

2.Local Modules
Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js application. 

3.Third-party modules
Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM). These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally. Some of the popular third-party modules are Mongoose, express, angular, and React.
