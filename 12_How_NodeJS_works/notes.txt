Node JS Achitecture

NodeJS is built on an event-driven architecture, which is fundamental to its asynchronous and non-blocking I/O model.

consist of 
1.Call Stack
 - The call stack is a crucial concept in JavaScriptâ€™s runtime environment, 
   representing the mechanism by which the JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls in a program. 
 - It operates as a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last function called is the first one to be resolved.

2.Node API
    This toolkit was introduced in Node 8.0.0 and acts as an intermediary between C/C++ code and the Node JavaScript engine. It allows C/C++ code to create, access, and manipulate JavaScript objects. 

3.CallBack Queue
    - the Callback Queue is where our callback functions will wait; they need to wait for the Call Stack to be empty.
